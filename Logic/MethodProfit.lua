-- Blackthornes Tradeskills -- Logic/MethodProfit.lua
-- What you made, by the way you made it.
--
-- Asked by a player on 2026-10-11 (the owner agreeing): is there a place that
-- shows the profit from crafting, disenchanting, vendoring and flipping
-- individual items? The Sales tab knew auction profit for crafted items only,
-- and the gold chart knows sources but not items. This brings them together:
--
--   Crafted       auction sales of things you made, against what they cost
--   Flipped       auction sales of things you bought on the auction house
--   Vendored      things a vendor bought from you
--   Disenchanted  what the materials are worth, against what the item cost
--   Farmed        auction sales of things you looted, gathered or fished
--                 (Blackthornes Farmer's records say so; no cost, all profit)
--   Other         auction sales of things with no cost known
--
-- Auction sales are read from the Sales tab's mail ledger, as they stand.
-- Vendor sales and disenchants have no ledger, so each is written down as it
-- happens (`events`), per realm, with no names. What was paid for an item on
-- the auction house is kept as a short list per item (`buys`) so a later sale
-- or disenchant has a cost to be measured against.
--
-- A cost is the craft cost when the item was crafted (Logic/CraftedCost.lua),
-- else the average of what was paid for it on the auction house. An item
-- with neither (loot) has no cost: it counts as all profit, and the figures
-- say how many units that was.
--
-- Nothing here is written into the ledger or rewrites an old record.
