-- Blackthornes Tradeskills -- Logic/SellOut.lua
-- Keep one more of a craft that sold out before its listings ran out, and
-- one fewer again once it keeps coming back unsold.
--
-- The owner asked (2026-10-13): when every copy of a craft you listed sells
-- within the auction's time (8 hours by default), Keep in stock for that
-- item goes up by 1. It only ever goes up, once a window, and only while
-- "Raise it when it sells out" is ticked (raiseStockOnSellOut, off unless
-- ticked).
--
-- A window opens when a listing of a craft is confirmed (Posting calls
-- NotePosted) and ends when the longest listing in it would run out; a
-- listing confirmed before then joins it. Nothing is decided until this
-- character's mailbox is read in full after the window ended (Mail:Read
-- calls MailRead), since that is the only place a listing that did not sell
-- shows up. Then:
--
--   * anything of it back in the mail (expired or cancelled) since the window
--     opened: not a sell out, the window closes and counts as unsold;
--     after UNSOLD_ROUNDS (3) unsold windows in a row, a number this raised
--     comes down by 1 (the owner, 2026-10-16), never below the number it
--     started from (`base`), and only while it is still the number this
--     set (one typed by hand is the new start);
--   * nothing back and at least one sale seen (a sale mail or the game's sale
--     notice): every copy sold, so the item's number goes up by 1 and the
--     unsold count starts again;
--   * nothing back and no sale seen yet: the sale mail can come an hour
--     late, so the window waits for the next reading.
--
-- Only an item with a number gets one more: no limit stays no limit. The
-- new number is set on the item itself (Auctions:SetLimit), so it shows in
-- the Profit tab's detail pane like one typed there.
--
-- Saved, never renamed: sellOutWatch[realm][character][itemID] = a list of
-- { from, ends, units }, sellOutRaised[itemID] = { at, from, to, base,
-- lowered } (account wide, like postLimits) for the Profit tab's note and
-- the floor, and sellOutUnsold[itemID] = unsold windows in a row.
