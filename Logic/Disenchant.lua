-- What an item is worth broken down into enchanting materials.
--
-- The game does not tell addons what an item disenchants into: there is no
-- call that answers it, and the result is only known once the spell has been
-- cast. So the chances below are built in. They are the Classic disenchant
-- table as players have long published it (item quality, item level and
-- whether it is armour or a weapon decide the result), which is the table
-- this Classic-era realm has behaved like so far. If Forever turns out to
-- differ, this table is the one place to change.
--
-- The value is the expected worth of one disenchant: for every material it
-- can give, the chance times the average count times that material's
-- auction value. It is a long-run average, not a promise about any one cast.
