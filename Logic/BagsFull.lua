-- last free slot goes, not while the bags stay full, and never at login.

-- the game quietly refused the rest. So the Buy materials button, and the
-- mailbox's Take next batch, bring only what fits, in step: the same share of
-- every material the queue needs, so what arrives makes whole crafts.
