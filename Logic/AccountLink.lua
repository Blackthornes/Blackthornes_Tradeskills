-- Blackthornes Tradeskills -- Logic/AccountLink.lua
-- Your characters on another account of yours, shared in game.
--
-- Asked 2026-10-07 (on Discord, the owner agreeing): recipes, bags,
-- gold and auctions from a second account, without a desktop app. Each side
-- names a character on the other account in Settings (Sharing), and while
-- both are logged in each sends the other its characters. They then show up
-- wherever this account's own alts do: the Characters tab, alt counts,
-- "Bob can make this", Keep in stock.
--
-- What keeps it safe:
--   * Only whispers, only from a name this side added, and only when that
--     side added this one too (a hello from anyone else gets no answer).
--   * A received character is a copy, marked `linkedFrom`. It never
--     replaces, merges into or deletes one of this account's own
--     characters, and is never passed on to anyone else.
--   * Only known fields are taken, each checked for its type; strings lose
--     their "|" (no colour, link or texture codes from someone else).
--   * Each side chooses what it sends (recipes, bags, gold, auctions).
--
-- Saved as ordinary character records in `characters[guid]`, with
-- `linkedFrom`, `linkedAt` and `linkHash`. Never rename those: a record
-- without `linkedFrom` would read as one of this account's own.
