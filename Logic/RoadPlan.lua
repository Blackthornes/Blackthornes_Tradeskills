-- Blackthornes Tradeskills -- Logic/RoadPlan.lua
-- Road to 300 (the owner said build it, 2026-10-20, from a mockup): the
-- whole way up one profession, from the skill the character has to 300,
-- laid out as steps on the Level Up tab (UI/RoadView.lua).
--
-- Each stretch of skill takes the recipe that costs least for each point it
-- gives there: a recipe the character knows, or one a trainer or vendor of
-- their side teaches (Logic/LearnNext.lua), its price counted once. Below
-- yellow every craft gives a point; from yellow to grey the chance falls
-- to nothing, (grey - skill) / (grey - yellow), so a point takes
-- 1 / chance crafts. A step is one recipe in one colour; it ends where the
-- colour changes, a trainer is due or another recipe is clearly cheaper.
--
-- Trainer steps follow Classic's ranks: Journeyman at 50 (level 10) to 150,
-- Expert at 125 (level 20) to 225, Artisan at 200 (level 35) to 300.
--
-- What the character owns (bags, then bank) is taken off the materials
-- once, step by step in order. Steps below the skill the character has are
-- shown done. Nothing is saved: the plan is kept by a key (skill, cap,
-- level, recipes, bags, scans) and worked out again only when it moves,
-- the recipes priced a few a frame.
--
-- Pick By (the owner said build it, 2026-10-27, from a mockup): "lowest"
-- ranks recipes by what their materials cost, as before; "real" takes off
-- what one craft sells back for (LevelUp:GetReturns), so a craft that pays
-- some back can win. Kept account wide in `roadPickBy` (never rename it).
