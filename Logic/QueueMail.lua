-- What to mail to your other characters for the shared craft queue.
--
-- The queue gives each craft to a character (Logic/Queue.lua, "Who makes
-- what"). The tailor makes the bolts for Ana's bag, so the tailor needs
-- the wool, and Ana needs the bolts once they are made. At a mailbox this
-- works out what the character logged in holds that another one needs, and
-- UI/QueueMailPanel.lua offers to fill a mail with it.
--
-- Nothing is ever sent from here. The panel fills in the name and the
-- attachments, and the player presses Send: postage costs money, and a mail
-- cannot be taken back once sent.
--
-- What has been mailed is written down (`BlackthornesTSDB.queueMail.sent`),
-- because the other character's bags are only known as they were when it
-- last logged out. Without it, every visit to the mailbox would offer the
-- same wool again until the tailor logged in.
--
-- Crafts made for someone else are written down too (`queueMail.owed`): a
-- craft you queued that only an alt can make is taken off the queue as the
-- alt makes it, and the record is what says the result still has to go back.
