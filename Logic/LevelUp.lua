-- Blackthornes Tradeskills -- Logic/LevelUp.lua
-- The cheapest way up a profession.
--
-- The Profit tab asks what is worth making for gold. This asks a different
-- question: which of the crafts you know will raise your skill, and which of
-- those costs least to make. So the order is the skill-up colour first
-- (orange, then yellow, then green, grey last) and material cost second,
-- cheapest first.
--
-- Nothing here prices anything on its own. The difficulty is what
-- Logic/SkillUp.lua stored when the profession window was last open, and the
-- cost is Logic/Cost.lua's, the very number the Profit tab shows, so the two
-- tabs can never disagree about what a craft costs. That includes the rule
-- that an in-between material counts at whichever is cheaper, buying it or
-- making it.
--
-- Soulbound crafts are kept. They cannot be sold, which is why the Profit
-- list drops them, but they level a profession as well as anything.

-- back ranks as the cheaper way up (asked 2026-10-05). It is the plain
-- material cost where nothing comes back.
--
-- A craft whose materials have no price goes after every priced one in its
-- band. Treating a missing price as free would put it on top, and that is
-- exactly the craft you know least about.
--
-- Every tie falls through to the recipe ID. `pairs` hands recipes over in no
-- particular order, and a comparator that can call two rows equal makes the
-- list reshuffle itself on every refresh.
