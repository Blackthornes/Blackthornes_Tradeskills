-- What a craft cost when you made it, and what you last listed it at.
--
-- Asked by a player on 2026-10-05: everywhere else a craft's cost is worked
-- out again from today's prices, so something made last week and listed
-- today was judged against what its materials cost now, not what was paid.
-- This keeps the cost from the moment it was made, and the price it last
-- went up at, so the two can be read beside what it would list for now.
--
-- Kept per realm, like the mail ledger: a price means something on one
-- realm's auction house only, and a craft mailed to a bank alt on the same
-- realm keeps its cost. No character names are kept, only items, prices
-- and times.
--
-- The setting "Never below what I paid" (neverBelowCraftedCost, off by
-- default) makes Post refuse any price that, after the auction house's cut,
-- brings in less than the last craft cost. It sits beside the material cost
-- guard (allowPostingAtALoss), which compares against today's prices.

-- What a sale made
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Asked by two players on 2026-10-06: the Sales tab said what each sale took
-- in, but not whether it made anything over what the item cost. A sale is
-- costed, best first, from:
--
--   "made"  the cost written on the sale when it was recorded, or failing
--           that the last craft cost if that craft came before the sale;
--   "est"   what the materials cost today, for something sold before its
--           craft cost was being kept (or made on a character that never
--           cast it since);
--   nil     neither: bought rather than made, or nothing to price it with.
--
-- A sale mail does not say how many were in the stack, so a sale counts as
-- one unless the ledger recorded a quantity.

--- A lookup kept for one pass over the ledger: which recipe makes an item,
--- and today's estimate for it, worked out once however many sales it has.
