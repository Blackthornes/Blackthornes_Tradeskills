-- What each recipe is worth, written into Blizzard's own profession list.
--
-- The craft pane beside the profession window already answers "what should I
-- make next". This answers a smaller question in the place you are already
-- looking: standing in front of the recipe list, what does one of these sell
-- for. A value beside the name means not having to read across to another
-- frame to find out.
--
-- Nothing here is assumed about the shape of Blizzard's list, because this
-- client is not retail and a wrong guess about a frame is silent: the value
-- simply never appears, which looks exactly like the addon not being loaded.
-- So the list is *discovered* -- several shapes are tried in order, each one
-- is judged by whether its rows actually name recipes this character knows,
-- and the one that worked is remembered. `/bts value` then reports which it
-- was and how many rows are carrying a value right now. That report is the
-- observation; everything else here is a guess until it has been read in game.
--
-- Blizzard's frames are read, hooked and given a child FontString. None of
-- them is assigned to, and no field is written onto one: the labels live in a
-- weak table keyed by the row, so a Blizzard frame carries nothing of ours.
