-- Logic/MethodProfit.lua outside WoW: profit by the way it was made.
--
--   1. What was paid on the auction house becomes a cost, averaged per item.
--   2. Auction sales sort into crafted, flipped and other by their cost.
--   3. A vendor's buyback list gives sales: the first look is the baseline,
--      what is new afterwards was just sold, and a repeat look adds nothing.
--   4. A disenchant is the materials' worth against what the item cost.
--   5. A period holds only what happened inside it; loot has no cost and
--      counts as all profit, with its units counted as unknown.
