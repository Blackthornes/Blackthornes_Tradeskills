-- Blackthornes Tradeskills -- Data/Mail.lua
-- The mailbox: stock you own but cannot see, and the record of what sold.
--
-- Two jobs, deliberately independent of each other.
--
-- The first is stock. An auction that expires comes back as mail, and until you
-- collect it that item is counted nowhere: it has dropped off your auctions and
-- it is not in your bags yet. The Profit tab would cheerfully tell you to craft
-- more of something already on its way home. Anything sitting in the mailbox is
-- yours, so it counts.
--
-- The second is reconciliation. A listing leaves and something comes back --
-- either gold, because it sold, or the item, because it did not. Nothing in the
-- addon recorded which. Owned auctions are read fresh each time, so a sale and
-- an expiry look identical: the listing is simply gone. This keeps a ledger, so
-- "the Profit tab said 3s profit" can be checked against what the auction house
-- actually paid.
--
-- The stock half needs no interpretation at all -- an item in the mailbox is an
-- item in the mailbox. The ledger half has to work out WHY a mail arrived, and
-- that rests on the client exposing its own auction mail subjects. Where it
-- does not, the stock half still works and the ledger simply records less;
-- `/bts mail` reports which of the two you are getting.
